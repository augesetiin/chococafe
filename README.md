ChocoCafe: A Coffee Shop Landing Page ☕

Welcome to the repo for my ChocoCafe landing page project!

The goal was to create a warm and welcoming page for a coffee shop that serves fresh, organic coffee. It’s fully responsive, so it works on any device. This was an assignment for my internship to show what I can do with front-end code.
